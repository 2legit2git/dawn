# On Incompleteness

The most honest works are the ones that admit they are not finished. Rodin left chisel marks visible. Schubert's symphony remains unfinished not because he died, but because he stopped. Kafka instructed Max Brod to burn everything.

They understood something: *completion is a kind of death*.

## The Fragment as Form

We pretend that wholeness is the goal. But consider what survives of Sappho—scattered lines, words torn from context:

> Someone, I tell you, will remember us,
> even in another time.

Two lines. Enough. The fragments do what complete works cannot: they **leave room**. The reader enters through the gaps.

### What Remains of the Library at Alexandria

| What Was Lost | What Survived | How |
|:--------------|:-------------:|----:|
| Aristotle's dialogues | His lecture notes | Students copied them |
| Sappho's nine volumes | 650 scattered lines | Quotations in other texts |
| Aeschylus's 80+ plays | 7 complete tragedies | Anthology selections |
| The original *Iliad* | Edited reconstructions | Byzantine scribes |

The pattern is clear: survival is arbitrary. What we call "the canon" is simply what didn't burn.

## The Mathematics of Loss

If we consider textual survival as a function of time and circumstance:

$$
P(\text{survival}) = \int_0^T \frac{c(t)}{e^{\lambda t}} \, dt
$$

Where $c(t)$ represents the number of copies at time $t$, and $\lambda$ is the decay constant—fire, flood, indifference. The integral rarely converges to anything but zero.

And yet some things persist. The probability of the *Iliad* surviving 2,800 years was vanishingly small. Someone, at every generation, chose to copy it again.

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n} P_i(\text{copy}) > 0 \implies \text{survival}
$$

A chain of individual decisions, each one improbable, multiplying to something like permanence.

## On Writing Anyway

The case against writing has always been strong:

- Most work will be forgotten
- Language itself decays and shifts
- Even preserved texts get misread
- The author's intent becomes irrelevant

None of this matters. The act of writing is not about permanence. It is about the *present tense of thinking*—the moment when scattered intuitions find their shape in syntax.

### Tools of the Trade

Writers have always been particular about their instruments. Nabokov wrote on index cards. Didion typed on an IBM Selectric. The tool shapes the thought:

```
Morning routine:
  1. Coffee, black, no exceptions
  2. Silence for the first hour
  3. Write before reading anything
  4. Stop mid-sentence (Hemingway's trick)

The unfinished sentence pulls you back tomorrow.
```

The best tools disappear. You should not notice the pen, the keyboard, the interface. You should notice only the sentence forming.

## Marginalia

The books that matter to us bear evidence of reading. Coleridge filled margins with arguments. Keats underlined and starred. Plath's copy of *The Great Gatsby* contains her handwritten note: "I want to write like this."[^plath]

These traces are a form of conversation across time. The margin is where the reader becomes a writer.

> The book you read is not the book the author wrote. It is a collaboration between their words and your attention.

This applies to everything. The symphony exists only in performance. The poem exists only in reading. The fragment completes itself differently in every mind that encounters it.

## A Defense of Difficulty

Easy reading is not always good reading. Consider:

- [x] Clarity of thought
- [x] Precision of language
- [ ] Immediate accessibility
- [ ] Universal appeal

The last two are often false virtues. Difficulty can be a form of respect—the assumption that the reader will rise to meet the work. Dickinson's dashes. Faulkner's sentences. Tarkovsky's long takes.

These demand *attention*. In an age of distraction, demanding attention is almost a political act.

### The Paradox of Simplicity

The simplest-seeming works are often the hardest to make. Consider how much must be removed to arrive at:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Or:

> So it goes.

Years of thought compressed into a handful of symbols. The simplicity is not the starting point—it is the *destination*.

## Endings

There is no satisfying way to end an essay about incompleteness. Any conclusion would betray the theme.

So instead: a list of things left undone, which may be the most honest form.

1. The novel outlined but never begun
2. The letter composed mentally but never sent
3. The conversation that ended too soon
4. The revision that would have fixed everything
5. This sentence, which

*Written in an application designed for focused composition, where the interface recedes and only the words remain.*
